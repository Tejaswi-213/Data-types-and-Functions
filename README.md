"Sharing my learning outcomes on Python:



I started with data types, strings, numeric data types, functions in data types, and some regular expressions. For example, data types include integers, floats, and strings. Functions in data types allow you to manipulate these values, such as using len() to get the length of a string. 



I also did some practical exercises on my code spaces. Iâ€™m attaching my GitHub link here with practical examples on how to use data types, strings, numeric data types, and functions in data types."
